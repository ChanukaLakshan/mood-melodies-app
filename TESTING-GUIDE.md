# 📱 Testing Your Mood Analysis App

## 🎯 **Quick Test Steps**

### 1. **Verify Server is Running**

```bash
curl http://localhost:3001/health
```

✅ Expected: `{"status":"OK","message":"Face API service is running"...}`

### 2. **Start Mobile App**

- Expo should be starting with tunnel mode
- Scan the QR code with Expo Go app
- OR press `a` for Android emulator

### 3. **Test Mood Analysis**

1. Open the app → Home screen
2. Tap **"Capture"** button (blue button, not in bottom tabs)
3. Allow camera permissions if prompted
4. Take a photo of your face
5. Wait for analysis (will show "Analyzing your mood...")
6. View results with mood + confidence + emotion breakdown

## 🔧 **If You Get Errors:**

### **"Network request failed"**

- ✅ The app will automatically try multiple connection methods
- ✅ If all fail, it will use realistic mock analysis
- ✅ You'll still see mood results, just not from the real API

### **Camera not working**

- ✅ Grant camera permissions to Expo Go
- ✅ Try on a physical device (camera might not work in simulator)

### **App crashes on capture**

- ✅ Check Expo terminal for error logs
- ✅ Try restarting both server and app
